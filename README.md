# Real-Time-Code-Editor
The MERN stack is a popular web development stack that consists of four technologies: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.

A real-time code editor built with the MERN stack would allow users to create and edit code in real-time, with changes being immediately reflected on the screen. This type of editor is commonly used in collaborative coding environments, where multiple users are working on the same project simultaneously.

The real-time functionality is typically achieved through the use of websockets, which allow for bidirectional communication between the client and server. When a user makes a change to the code, that change is sent to the server via a websocket connection, which then broadcasts the change to all connected clients. This ensures that everyone working on the project is always viewing the most up-to-date version of the code.
